# ChiaParser
Chia parser that i made for pass filter and proof chek.
Simple. Small. With sound.

Mainly it parse wide info from you'r debug.log file in .chia.

In order to use this, you will need to:
1. Go to you'r %USERNAME_FOLDER%/.chia/mainnet/config
2. Open with an text editor config.yaml
3. With search find setting log_level
4. Change it to INFO, if it's not
5. Save file
6. REOPEN Chia GUI
7. Download folder Applocation
8. Launch programm
9. Profit...

Programm will show you and tell you, if any of your plot's passed filter and when, 
how much filters was not passed, was passed filter in total and will tell, if any proof 
were found.

That it. 
Maybe later i will add some grafic UI
